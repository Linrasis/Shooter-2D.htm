Shooter-2D.htm
--------------

A 2D topdown arena shooter. See how many times you can hit your opponent before you fail to dodge their return fire, or pit yourself against a horde of brainless undead! Two arenas and a cemetary await your combat. You can customize your weapon reload speed for a different pace of combat and customize your keybinds. Settings are saved in localStorage.
